    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Stichting voor Open Contracting (SvOC) works to strengthen open contracting in Europe by supporting systemic reforms for fair and effective public procurement. SvOC brings governments, businesses, and citizens together to ensure that public money is spent openly, fairly, and effectively—so that everyone can access the public goods, works, and services they need. SvOC supports reforms across Europe, including in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Balkans.</p>

    <h2>Policy Plan</h2>
